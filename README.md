# Weather App

This app was created using Angular JS 1.5 from seed NG6 Starter (https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter) customized to my own personal taste.

It basically fetches an api and display the results on screen.

This is the result of an excersive for live coding, I'm just sharing it as a portfolio of what I've made.

## How to run it...

You need to have installed first Git, Node JS and NPM to handle dependencies.

Once you've done that, run the followings commands:

    git clone https://github.com/hernanfarruggia/weather-app.git
    
    cd weather-app

    npm install
    
    npm start

And that's it! You should be able to run it without troubles!

Enjoy!
